# This script opens preprocessed pickle file containing 3 DataFrames: Centroid,
# Well Timeseries, and well location.
# High level does 3 things:
# 1: Extracts Well Time series, and drops any well without a minimum amount
#    of Data within a user specified window
# 2: Interpolates subset of data, removing gaps larger than user specified size
#    Gaps will be filled in using a machine learning algorithm. This step
#    is based on the assumption that groundwater changes are slow, and readings
#    will remain valid for a time period after the original reading.
# 3: Contains support functions of data augmentation such as Rolling-Window
#    averages and plotting.

# extractwelldata extracts waterlevel measurements and creates a pandas data
# Bcap and Fcap are bottom and final cap, this control guarrenties that wells
# will contain data before and after the caps
# MinEx is the minimum number examples required within dataset
# extract the data into a panda data frame

# now need to resample well data to begining of month ('1MS') or chosen period
# next most used will be 'QS' Quarter Start Frequency
# need to fill with NaNs on large gaps
# interpolate the well data to regular interval
# do not interpolate for large gaps (gap size can be set in function)
# provide data on either side of measured data - no nans - can be set in func
# can select data interval in function pad 90, 180, 120
