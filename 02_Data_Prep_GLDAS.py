# Purpose of this script is to:
# 1) Create a grid in the likeness of the netcdf we're interested in querying.
# 2) Using the grid, identify which cells are located within a shape file boundary.
# 3) Use the grids package, and to query the time series, for the variables and cells
#    the user has specified.
# 4) Save data as a pickle file.
